    <p>For: Money is an effective, powerful and simple motivator. Self-evidently, money motivates and extra money motivates people to work extra hard. It is natural to compete, and when rewarded with money for better work then productivity and standards are raised for all. Further, because it is not always wise or indeed possible to promote individu-als, money can be used as an equitable and very acceptable way to reward all workers. More important, because money is a “generalized reinforcer” it is always acceptable to all people everywhere and at all times. Money talks, and it talks loudly and clearly.</p>
    <p>Money sometimes, but not always, motivates. For those who are very well paid, even quite large amounts have a minimal motivational effect. Worse, money rewards can and do set employees against one another, leading to conflict, disharmony and reduced teamwork. It leads as much to a win-lose as a win-win philosophy. Also, it is very difficult in many jobs to determine or measure an individual is work performance accurately and equitably to decide how much money to award.</p>

    <p>Manufacturers use genetic modification to give foods desirable traits. For example, they have designed two new varieties of apple that turn less brown when cut or bruised.The reasoning usually involves making crops more resistant to diseases as they grow. Manufacturers also engineer produce to be more nutritious or tolerant of herbicides.Crop protection is the main rationale behind this type of genetic modification. Plants that are more resistant to diseases spread by insects or viruses result in higher yields for farmers and a more attractive product.Genetically modification can also increase nutritional value or enhance flavor.All of these factors contribute to lower costs for the consumer. They can also ensure that more people have access to quality food.</p>
    <p>Because genetically engineering foods is a relatively new practice, little is known about the long-term effects and safety.There are many purported downsides, but the evidence varies, and the main health issues associated with GMO foods are hotly debated. Research is ongoing.This section discusses the evidence for a range of drawbacks that people often associate with GMO foods.</p>

    <p>Think about you in 2100. Yeah, I know, it is difficult. That is because we have difficulty relating to our future selves. The further into the future we look, the more of a stranger our future self is for us. 2100 is very far away, so it is almost impossible for us to visualize ourselves then and to feel empathy for that future us.Also, most of us probably think we will not be alive anyway. It is too far away. I will be 121 years old. Who lives to that age? Not many people nowadays, but people like Ray Kurzweil, who aims to live long enough, to live forever, think otherwise. Kurzweil and other techno-utopians believe that advances in biotechnology, genetics, and medicine will allow us to live much longer lives in good health, or even achieve some kind of a-mortality and never again die due to health-related complications.</p>
